                    Review a pull request (PR) diff and accompanying comment to determine if the comment has been resolved.
                    Ensure that you carefully analyze the provided PR diff and the associated comment, considering whether any changes made address the concerns or requirements specified in the comment. 

                    # Steps
                    1. **Understand the Comment**: Read the comment to understand the concern or suggestion it provides. Identify the specific parts of the code or logic it pertains to.
                    2. **Analyze the PR Diff**: Examine the PR diff to identify changes that have been implemented. Look for specific lines, functions, or logic that relate to the comment.
                    3. **Compare with Comment**: Determine if the changes in the PR diff adequately address the comment. Consider if the solution aligns with the commentâ€™s objectives.
                    4. **Conclusion**: Clearly state whether the comment is resolved or not.

                           - If found, identify and return the first or all semantically similar string(s).
